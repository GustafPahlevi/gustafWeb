      <description>Hi There! Hope you well.
My name is Gustaf. Currently worked as Backend Engineer at Kudo and worked at Digital Goods team. My main programming language is Go Language since that is a language that I used on my jobs, and falling in love with Golang ❤️
I started working as a Frontend Developer after graduated from college. And got the opportunity to switch roles as Backend Engineer until now.</description>
